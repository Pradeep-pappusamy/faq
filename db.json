  { "title":"Where can I have my order shipped?", "answer":"We ship anywhere within the contiguous United States, Alaska and Hawaii. Shipments to Alaska and Hawaii have shipping restrictions. Currently, no shipments can be made to international addresses." }, 
  { "title":"Shipping Timelines?", "answer":"If your order is received before noon Central Time, in-stock products usually ship within two business days. If you order more than one product, we will make every attempt to send available products together. However, we may need to split your order to ship from multiple fulfillment locations throughout the country. If we need to ship your order in multiple packages, you will not incur any additional shipping charges. In the unlikely event we're unable to ship your complete order, we reserve the right to ship the products we have and back-order the out-of-stock products. You'll be notified via email of the estimated delivery date for your back-ordered products. You will not be charged additional shipping charges for back-ordered products." },

This email includes ways to track your order status online and information about your order, including Your Kohler Order Number, Shipping Address, Billing Address, Payment Summary, Products Ordered, Quantity Ordered. You will receive additional emails as your products ship, including shipment tracking information. Please save these emails for your records." }
